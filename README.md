HT1632C
=======

Arduino library for the HT1632C. This chip is used to drive the Sure3208, a 32x8 LED display matrix as well as other similar panels.

The base for this library was taken from the 8x32 version of Miles Burton's HT1632 library, http://download.milesburton.com/Arduino/Sure2416/MatrixDisplay_201B_0832Version.zip and adapted for use with the HT1632C driver and Arduino 1.0
